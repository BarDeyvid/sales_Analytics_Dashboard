Project Idea: Sales Performance Dashboard

Objective:
Create an interactive sales analytics dashboard that provides insights into sales performance, trends, and key metrics over time. 
The dashboard should allow business stakeholders to explore different sales data points, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies.

Features:

    Total Sales Overview:
        Display total sales for a given period (daily, weekly, monthly).
        Include visualizations such as bar charts or line graphs to show sales trends.

    Sales by Region/Store/Product:
        Allow users to filter sales data by different categories (region, store, or product).
        Use pie charts or stacked bar charts to display the breakdown of sales by region or category.

    Sales Growth/Decline:
        Show percentage change in sales compared to the previous period (month-over-month, year-over-year).
        A line graph or bar chart can represent this growth over time.

    Top Performing Products:
        Highlight the top-selling products based on total sales volume or revenue.
        Use bar charts or tables that allow sorting by highest to lowest sales.

    Sales by Channel:
        Show a comparison between online sales and in-store sales using a stacked bar chart or a donut chart.

    Customer Segmentation Insights:
        Analyze sales based on customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, location).
        Scatter plots or histograms to visualize customer purchasing behavior and trends.

    Sales Correlation Analysis:
        Provide a heatmap to identify any correlations between different variables (e.g., price vs. quantity sold, promotions vs. sales).

    Revenue vs. Costs:
        Display the difference between total revenue and total costs over time.
        A line graph could show how profits have changed over the selected period.

    Forecasting:
        Implement a simple sales forecasting model using historical data to predict future sales trends.
        Display the forecast alongside actual sales for comparison.

    Interactive Filters:
        Allow users to filter by date range, region, store, or product to analyze specific sales data.

Tools:

    NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation (e.g., handling missing data, aggregating sales by various dimensions).
    Matplotlib: For visualizing the data (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons).
